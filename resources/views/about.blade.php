                    We are a team of women — makers & designers — working together to create beautiful, personalized items. The Good Road began in 2016 as a one-woman travel blog, creating unique,
                    personalized travel videos and travel itineraries. Now The Good Road has developed into a luxury gifting company with the help of my little sister. While our speciality will
                    always be gifts for bridesmaids, engagements, bridal showers and weddings, we now offer gifts to celebrate all of life's occasions, big and small.
