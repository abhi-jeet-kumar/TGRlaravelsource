                    Many things affect employee morale - office conflicts, overtime and even the weather. As a supervisor, you can help boost employee morale by giving employees gifts that let
                    them know that their work is important and valued. And that’s exactly what the <b>Daydreamer Film Co.</b> did. After a long and hard shoot and editing schedule as a
                    <b>Video Production House</b>, the head of the firm decided to get a gift box curated for his employees to boost their morale and provide the much-needed motivation.And this
                    gesture need not put you over budget, as even inexpensive gifts will provide a boost.
